# Blackjack 
A simple card game created with Python GUI
The game consists of a player and dealer with a scoreboard
The rules in this game are same to a traditional Blackjack game with 21 being the highest score.
There is also a scoreboard which calculates the wins and losses of player. I did not make for the dealer as there was no reason at that time.
