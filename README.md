# Blackjack 
A simple card game created with Python GUI Tkinter library.
The game consists of a player and dealer with a scoreboard 
The rules in this game are same to a traditional Blackjack game with 21 being the highest score.
The game has an option to suffle new card if the user wishes 
A new game button is also included which restarts the game.
There is also a scoreboard which calculates the wins and losses of player. I did not make for the dealer as there was no reason at that time.
