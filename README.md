# BlackJack Demo

A simple card game created with Python GUI Tkinter library.
The purpose of the project was to understand the concept of functions, lists and Tkinter.

## Getting Started

There are several files namely blackjack.py, import_test.py and the card folder which contains card images.
For testing and installation, download them all in one folder and run blackjack.py once there are no errors.


### Prerequisites

I have use Python v3.5 here.
Import Tkinter Library as it is preinstalled with Python.

### Rules
Rules
-The rules in this game are same to a traditional Blackjack game with 21 being the highest score.
-The game has an option to suffle new card if the user wishes 
-A new game button is also included which restarts the game.
-There is also a scoreboard which calculates the wins and losses of player. This was added by me as it was not originally taught by the instructor. I have not made more improvements because i do not enjoy playing cards but i thought of adding a scoreboard as it makes sense. 

### Credits
The concept and the idea was taught on Udemy.com
